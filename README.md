# DU-Emergency-Controller
Emergency Controller script for Dual Universe

This script, when installed in an Emergency Controller, will apply brakes and gradually lower your ship to the ground, then turn itself off. Useful when you don't feel like taking the time to land, but instead want to jump out of your ship in midair and and run off to do whatever, confident that your ship will land itself behind you.

Copy the entire contents of the Emergency Controller script and paste them to your controller in-game.
Requires 1 hover engine or booster engine connected to the Emergency Controller slot labeled 'hover'. Emergency Controller also needs to be linked to the ship's core in the slot labeled 'core'. Make sure your Emergency Controller is turned on before attempting to jump out of your ship in midair.
