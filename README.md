# DU-Emergency-Controller
Emergency Control Unit script for Dual Universe

This script, when installed in an Emergency Controller, will adjust pitch to glide down to hover distance. Once within hover distance it will apply brakes and gradually lower your ship to the ground, then turn itself off.

Copy the entire contents of the Emergency Controller script and paste them to your Emergency Control Unit in-game.

Requires 1 hover engine or booster engine linked to the Emergency Control Unit slot labeled 'hover'. Emergency Control Unit also needs to be linked to the ship's core in the slot labeled 'core'. 

Make sure your Emergency Control Unit is turned on before attempting to jump out of your ship in midair.
